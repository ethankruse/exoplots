## Periodâ€“Radius Distribution for Confirmed and Candidate Planets

{% include period_radius_candidates_embed.html %}

This interactive figure shows all the currently confirmed transiting exoplanets
along with planet candidates from the three major transit missions.
If the tap tool is on, clicking on a particular planet will open its appropriate
details page on either Exoplanet Archive or ExoFOP-TESS. Clicking on the
labels in the legend allows you to turn on and off individual collections of
planets. Clicking on the color tools up top allow you to select your own color
palette. Selecting a region with the lasso or box select tools then clicking 
on the download button will give you a list of the planets in your area of 
interest.
